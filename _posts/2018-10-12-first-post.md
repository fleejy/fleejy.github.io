"Health Informatics? What's that?" That was my response when I first heard about the discipline of health informatics 5 years ago.

Now that I am almost one month into my master's program, I realize that it is becoming easier to find different ways to explain health informatics: "applying technology to health care."

Still too broad...how about...optimizing workflows both physically and virtually, but for health care.

Growing up, my parents emphasized the importance of flow. Whether it be in cleaning my room or cooking a Korean dish, the most important aspect was flow. For cooking, I learned to clean as I cooked and to prepare cold dishes before hot dishes and et cetera.

I didn't realize until one of my information courses that there was a whole discipline dedicated to the study of flows!

On a side note, I have a fond memory of my first year biology course:
> "How do cells know when to stop dividing? They are sensitive to concentration of certain particles. Concentration comes with accumulation. Accumulation comes with time."

This particular progression of time-dependent flow was fascinating to me. Ever since then and whenever I become impatient, I remind myself of the time-dependency in many facets of life.

So why is flow so important? I think the difference between good and great (often we fail to recognize the difference) stems from how well the process was designed with the process flow in consideration. My biggest weakness is impatience which manifests itself through shortsightedness. Without patience, there cannot exist foresight which is an essential characteristic of a professional who can optimize flows.

So far, the courses are fruitful in helping me develop that foresight.
