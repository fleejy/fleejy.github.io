"Health Informatics. What's that?" That was my response when I first heard about the discipline of health informatics.

Now that I am almost one month into my master's program, I realize that maintaining balance in grad school is more challenging than I thought it would be. I am embarrassed to admit that I have skipped my regular gym sessions to catch up on readings. I reduced sleep time to meet deadlines. I have substituted healthy meals, for quick and convenient fast food. I have also focused so intensely on my studies, that I have neglected quiet time to be still, meaningfully reflect, and pray.
