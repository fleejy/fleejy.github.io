I'm a Master of Health Informatics student in the <a href="http://ihpme.utoronto.ca/">Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (IHPME)</a>, <a href="http://dlsph.utoronto.ca/">Dalla Lana School of Public Health (DLSPH)</a>, <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. I am training as a health informatician to lead organizational and health system change through combining expertise in health systems with information and communication technologies. I strive to develop new skills and improve myself as a professional.

I majored in Cognitive Sciecne at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>.

I was born in Jinju, South Korea. In 2003, my family immigrated to Canada and I grew up in Coquitlam, British Columbia. Following the footsteps of my siblings, I moved to Montreal for university.
