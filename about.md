I'm a Master of Health Informatics student in the <a href="http://ihpme.utoronto.ca/">Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (IHPME)</a>, <a href="http://dlsph.utoronto.ca/">Dalla Lana School of Public Health (DLSPH)</a>, <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. I am training as a health informatician to lead organizational and health system change through combining expertise in health systems with information and communication technologies. I strive to develop new skills and improve myself as an individual.

I majored in Cognitive Sciecne at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>.
I am currently in the process of completing my <a href="https://ce-online.ryerson.ca/ce/default.aspx?id=3668">Certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics</a> at the Chang School of Continuing Education, Ryerson University. Over the next few weeks, I will be posting my experience about the certificate program, but also my progress in the capstone course (CKME 136).

I am a Korean-Canadian and I was born in Jinju, South Korea. In 2003, my family immigrated to Canada and I grew up in Coquitlam, British Columbia. Following the footsteps of my siblings (fun fact: I have 4 siblings), I moved to Montréal for university.
